        <p class="intense-text">I've been tryna call</p>
        <p class="intense-text">I've been on my own for long enough</p>
        <p class="happy-text">Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe</p>
        <p class="sad-text">I'm going through withdrawals</p>
        <p class="happy-text">You don't even have to do too much</p>
        <p class="happy-text">You can turn me on with just a touch, baby</p>
        
        <p class="happy-text">I look around and</p>
        <p class="sad-text">Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)</p>
        <p class="sad-text">No one's around to judge me (Oh)</p>
        <p class="sad-text">I can't see clearly when you're gone</p>
        
        <p class="chorus-text">I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights</p>
        <p class="chorus-text">No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch</p>
        <p class="chorus-text">I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night</p>
        <p class="chorus-text">Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust</p>
        <p class="chorus-text">Hey, hey, hey</p>
        
        <p class="happy-text">I'm running out of time</p>
        <p class="happy-text">'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky</p>
        <p class="happy-text">So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh</p>
        
        <p class="sad-text">The city's cold and empty (Oh)</p>
        <p class="sad-text">No one's around to judge me (Oh)</p>
        <p class="sad-text">I can't see clearly when you're gone</p>
        
        <p class="chorus-text">I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights</p>
        <p class="chorus-text">No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch</p>
        <p class="chorus-text">I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night</p>
        <p class="chorus-text">Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust</p>
        
        <p class="bridge-text">I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)</p>
        <p class="bridge-text">I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)</p>
        <p class="bridge-text">Will never let you go this time (Ooh)</p>
        
        <p class="chorus-text">I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights</p>
        <p class="chorus-text">No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch</p>
        <p class="chorus-text">Hey, hey, hey</p>
        <p class="chorus-text">Hey, hey, hey</p>
        
        <p class="chorus-text">I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights</p>
